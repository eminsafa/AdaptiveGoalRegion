    12-14 page for journals

easier IEEE conference CASE: deadline 1st of March
    then we can publish a journal but needs contribution
    6 page


early or mid january


1. Literature Review -> Furkan check ICRA19 paper for this
    Manipulation Planning with Workspace Goal Regions, Dimitry -> Check this

2. Overleaf
    Start thinking about structure
    Check dimitry paper

Introducing to goal regions?
Definition
Methods, algorithm

we can replicate structure of icra paper
    goal regions, man. planning, grasping planning. between 19-24
    clustiring?
    Clustering + Goal Region Planning
    select relevant papers


more test scenarios
    single objects?
    more objects, 10 objects?
    more real like objects
    coke can, water bottles
    clean the code
    they may ask to open the code

safa:
    clean code
    compare code: old version of vega then test. it will be worse however it will be realistic
    goal region <-> spline branch
    Real World Experiment
        with shelf

steven ask for link of cylinder or we can have can.

11 december: Furkan's report

mid-january: planned deadline


problem: making assumptions.
    those people doesnt consider where do those poses come from.
    it is very big assumptions
    not many paper doing this integration
    they dont care about feasibility

    LIMITATION: HOW TO CREATE REGION
    Not too many paper,


We need to mention how we use it.
Pretty much all of them same
It works better, it wont be a constrains.

Diagram: shows camera etc. Ranked
